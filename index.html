          <div class="cuba-text">
            In the Caribbean region, south of Florida, lies the island of Cuba.
            One of the most striking observations made by visitors are the
            amount of vintage cars filling the roads throughout this island
            country. In 1962, the United States imposed an embargo which
            prevented the US market from conducting trade and businesses with
            Cuba. This especially made imports of new vehicles extremely
            difficult, and it forced Cubans to preserve and maintain their
            already existing cars for a long time to come. <br />
            <div class="cuba-subheading">Cuban culture</div>
            Cuban culture Another concept often connected to this country is
            music and dance. These elements are deeply integrated in the Cuban
            culture and plays a vital role in gatherings and events as well as
            the expression of the island’s identity and spirit. Some well-known
            dance styles that originate from Cuba are salsa, rumba and
            cha-cha-cha, each pulsating with rhythms and charismatic movement
            drawing bystanders to the dance floor. And in the midst of such
            vibrant atmosphere, one can’t do any other than ache for a sip of a
            cool and refreshing mojito, right? This iconic Cuban cocktail, first
            created in the capital Havana in the 16th century, is a mix of white
            rum, sugar, soda water, lime juice and fresh mint leaves to help
            cool down on a hot day and increase relaxation.

              diverse population. The Houses of Parliament, along with the
              Elizabeth Tower (commonly known as Big Ben), are iconic symbols of
              British governance and democracy. Westminster Abbey, a gothic
              church where British monarchs are crowned and buried, is a UNESCO
              World Heritage site and a significant historical site.

            <div>
              Big Ben is one of the most recognizable landmarks in London and a
              symbol of the city itself. Often mistakenly used to refer to the
              entire clock tower, Big Ben actually denotes the Great Bell within
              the tower, while the structure as a whole is known as the
              Elizabeth Tower. The bell's iconic chimes have become synonymous
              with London and are broadcast globally, particularly during New
              Year's Eve celebrations and major national events.
