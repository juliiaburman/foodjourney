          <p class="cuba-text">
            In the Caribbean region, south of Florida, lies the island of Cuba.
            One of the most striking observations made by visitors are the
            amount of vintage cars filling the roads throughout this island
            country. In 1962, the United States imposed an embargo which
            prevented the US market from conducting trade and businesses with
            Cuba. This especially made imports of new vehicles extremely
            difficult, and it forced Cubans to preserve and maintain their
            already existing cars for a long time to come. Cuban culture Another
            concept often connected to this country is music and dance. These
            elements are deeply integrated in the Cuban culture and plays a
            vital role in gatherings and events as well as the expression of the
            island’s identity and spirit. Some well-known dance styles that
            originate from Cuba are salsa, rumba and cha-cha-cha, each pulsating
            with rhythms and charismatic movement drawing bystanders to the
            dance floor. And in the midst of such vibrant atmosphere, one can’t
            do any other than ache for a sip of a cool and refreshing mojito,
            right? This iconic Cuban cocktail, first created in the capital
            Havana in the 16th century, is a mix of white rum, sugar, soda
            water, lime juice and fresh mint leaves to help cool down on a hot
            day and increase relaxation.
