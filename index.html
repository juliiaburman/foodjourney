            In the Caribbean region, south of Florida, lies the island of Cuba.
            One of the most striking observations made by visitors are the
            amount of vintage cars filling the roads throughout this island
            country. In 1962, the United States imposed an embargo which
            prevented the US market from conducting trade and businesses with
            Cuba. This especially made imports of new vehicles extremely
            difficult, and it forced Cubans to preserve and maintain their
            already existing cars for a long time to come. Cuban culture Another
            concept often connected to this country is music and dance. These
            elements are deeply integrated in the Cuban culture and plays a
            vital role in gatherings and events as well as the expression of the
            island’s identity and spirit. Some well-known dance styles that
            originate from Cuba are salsa, rumba and cha-cha-cha, each pulsating
            with rhythms and charismatic movement drawing bystanders to the
            dance floor. And in the midst of such vibrant atmosphere, one can’t
            do any other than ache for a sip of a cool and refreshing mojito,
            right? This iconic Cuban cocktail, first created in the capital
            Havana in the 16th century, is a mix of white rum, sugar, soda
            water, lime juice and fresh mint leaves to help cool down on a hot
            day and increase relaxation.

              Iceland is a land of extremes, where fire and ice converge to
              create a landscape truly unlike any other.  Volcanos and Geysers
              One of Iceland’s most striking features is its terrain with
              majestic volcanos and dramatic lava fields. Here you can find over
              30 active volcanic systems, including the infamous
              Eyjafjallajökull. Because of the volcanos, the beaches become
              black. Adding to Iceland’s geological wonders are its geysers,
              natural hot springs that erupt with scalding water and steam.
              Whales and sharks Iceland’s coastal waters are teeming with life,
              making it one of the best places in the world for whale watching.
              A trip to Iceland would not be complete without sampling some of
              its unique culinary offerings, including Hákarl, fermented shark.
              Made since the 9th century and considered a delicacy by locals,
              However, it is worth noting that the shark is poisonous if not
              fermented properly, making it an acquired taste for adventurous
              foodies willing to brave its unique flavor.

              Something you can´t miss when visiting Sweden is the Swedish Fika,
              which has been famous for Sweden throughout the years. Fika is not
              a specific object, it´s more of a concept, a state of mind, an
              attitude, and an important part of Swedish culture. Fika doesn´t
              have a translation, but in English it could mean like “a coffee
              break”. A favorite sweet treat at the fika-table are cinnamon buns
              together with coffee, tea or another delicious drink.
